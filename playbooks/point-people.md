# Point People

Projects at Artsy have point people listed in the Meta section of their README,
for example:

https://github.com/artsy/reaction#meta

```
Point People: @alloy, @l2succes & @damassi
```

What this tells you is that @alloy, @l2succes & @damassi are the point people
for Reaction.

## Role of a point person

We want projects to be owned by teams overall, but lots of temporary ownership
over projects makes it hard to address technical debt, or to ensure a long-term
vision on a project. One solution to this is to define point people, who are
responsible for the long-term technical direction of a project, especially as a
project can change ownership between teams during its lifetime.

The point people for a project should change over time as people come and go,
and also grow if the project evolves in being more significant to us.

We want to be confident that someone is always looking out for the overall
vision of our projects so having an organic way to change who these people are
helps with this confidence.
